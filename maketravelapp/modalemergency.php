				Although the Faroe Islands are one of the safest countries in the world, travelling in the Faroe Islands might be different to what you are used to. It is important you are well aware of things like weather extremes, narrow, windy roads and different road rules before you begin your journey.<br><br>

				Always bring appropriate equipment, whether it be for hiking, camping, diving or birdwatching. Read about the various equipment under the websites that discuss each activity. In any case, it is always a good idea to bring warm clothes and a device to use for communication.<br><br>

				Be sure to let someone know your travel plans before you start exploring the Faroe Islands. These plans can be left with your host, a tour operator or the regional information centre in the region you will be exploring. We also recommend to bring a map, a compass and a GPS with you, particularly when travelling in isolated areas.<br><br>

				All major highways are paved, but some roads, especially to the smaller villages, are still gravel roads. Make sure to navigate these roads with care, as loose gravel can make driving difficult. Many roads and tunnels leading to villages can be very narrow, so please choose a safe speed according to the conditions. Note also that some roads are very narrow. To keep traffic flowing, these roads have lay-bys (widened sections formed to one side as to leave the road free for other to pass). These lay-bys are NOT to be used for parking.<br><br>

				The Faroese emergency number is 112. Never hesitate to use this number.<br><br>

				Should you get lost, do not wander off. Staying in the same place will make it easier for rescue teams to locate you.<br><br>

				Above all, always prepare before traveling to and within the Faroe Islands. Familiarizing yourself with the conditions will optimize your chance of a safe travel experience in the Faroe Islands.<br><br>

				Stay safe and enjoy exploring the Faroe Islands!<br>
