Public transport around the islands is efficient and wallet-friendly as ferries are government-subsidized and can cost as little as DKK 15. If you purchase multi-day Travel Cards (DKK 500 for 4 days), they can be used on all buses and ferries, with the exception of the one to Mykines. Additionally, you can catch a bus that travels around Tórshavn, including to the historic village of Kirjubøur. If you have the time to travel according to the pace of the timetables, you won’t even need to rent a car.


If taking a helicopter ride is on your must-do list, the Faroe Islands might be the best place to finally cross it off. Not only are the views wonderful, but helicopter travel is subsidized by the government so that locals can live on some of the archipelago’s more remote islands. For tourists, this means you can take a helicopter trip between islands for around DKK 125. The helicopter subsidy is a community initiative, so it is expected that tourists will only take advantage of it for a one-way trip (and return using a ferry).
